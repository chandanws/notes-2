# Useful BASH/Zshell commands

* java -jar briss-0.9.jar  
(in directory where briss-0.9.jar is located; requires java)  
Start up briss, app to crop/resize/split pdfs.

* qpdf -decrypt InputFile OutputFile  
Remove protection/encryption from pdf files

* find . -name '*.ntl'  
Find all files with the extension ‘.ntl’ in the current working directory (= .).
Files in subdirectories are also found.

* chmod -x $(find . -name '*.ntl')  
Change the file mode (chmod) by restricting execution (-x) for all files ending in ‘.ntl’.  
The file will no longer be an ‘Unix executable file’.  
=> This is necessary to have Python read it as text-type instead of binary-type

* grep -r "StringToFind" .  
Look for "StringToFind" in all files in the current directory (.)  
-r: look recursively (i.e. also look in subdirectories)

* ffmpeg -i input.mov -vcodec libx264 -crf 24 output.mp4  
Convert input.mov to output.mp4 and compresses the video with a constant rate
factor of 24!

* ffmpeg -i input.mov -acodec copy -vcodec copy output.mp4  
Only convert the video.

* ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b 1000000 output.mp4  
Change the bitrate (quality) to 1000000 bytes/sec.
(Calculate the bitrate you need by dividing 1 GB by the video length in seconds.
So, for a video of length 16:40 (1000 seconds), use a bitrate of 1000000 bytes/sec.)  
Bitrate= video in bytes/ length in seconds

* cat *.VOB > moviename.vob; ffmpeg -i moviename.vob -acodec libfaac -ac 2 -ab 128k -vcodec libx264 -vpre fast -crf 20 -threads 0 moviename.mp4  
Concatenate .vob dvd files, and then convert them to .mp4

* sudo fs_usage | grep [path_to_file]  
Find out which application is touching the file.

* for file in *.rar  
    $ do  
    $ mv "$file" "${file%.rar}.cbr"  
    $ done  

    => Batch rename all files in the current working directory from .rar to .cbr!  
    => Other option for same result: rename or mmv

* rename -S .rar .cbr *.rar

* mmv "long_name*.txt" "short_#1.txt"  
Where the "#1" is replaced by whatever is matched by the first wildcard.
Similarly #2 is replaced by the second, etc. Quotes are necessary!

So you do something like:

* mmv "index*_type*.txt" "t#2_i#1.txt"  
To rename index1_type9.txt to t9_i1.txt

* tail -f *.log  
Follows (-f) all log files, so you can troubleshoot.
(tail = last 10 lines)

More specific logs:  
* tail -f /var/log/kern.log    // kernel-only, i.e. dmesg output
* tail -f /var/log/syslog      // kernel + programs

* curl -i -X POST -d "isbn=978-1470184841&title=Metamorphosis&author=Franz Kafka&price=5.90" localhost:3000/books/create  
curl = see url; it returns the content at the requested url  
-i: include http headers  
-X: Specify request command to use (e.g. POST, default is GET)  
-d: HTTP POST data

* diff -u old_file new_file  
Check where the differences between 2 versions of a file are.  
(-u = unified diff format => easier to read.)

* ~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd  
Execute dropbox-daemon on Linux

* sudo lsof -i :8000  
Detect what process is listening to (and occupying) port 8000.

* sudo kill -9 <PID>  
Kill process with PID.
